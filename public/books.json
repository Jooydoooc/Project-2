          "text": "Everyone knows what a zipper is. It is found on many kinds of clothing—coats, pants, and skirts.\n\nThe zipper was invented by an American named Whitcomb Judson. He wanted to make it easier for people to fasten their shoes. His first zipper design did not work well, but it was the beginning of a great idea.\n\nLater, a Swedish-born engineer named Gideon Sundback improved the design. He made the zipper stronger and easier to use. Sundback's zipper became very successful and changed the clothing industry forever.",
